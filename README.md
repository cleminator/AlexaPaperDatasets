# Alexa Paper Datasets
This repository contains the full datasets that were obtained during the research for our paper "Using Amazon Alexa APIs as a Source of Digital Evidence".
The data is important for understanding the research that was done. However, due to its size it was not possible to include it directly in the paper.
The two files "datasets_echo_2nd_gen_raw.xml" and "datasets_echo_3rd_gen_raw.xml" contain the raw files that were generated by Burp Suite during the scraping of the Alexa website.
The files "datasets_echo_2nd_gen.json" and "datasets_echo_3rd_gen.json" are cleaned up versions of them, containing all the API requests together with their respective responses for the two devices that were analysed in a simple JSON format.
